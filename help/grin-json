Grin-Get packages can include a grin.json file.
This should represent an object with several optional fields.

bin
    The bin field can be a string delimited by colons, where each section is a path in the package where executables are found.
    Or the bin field can be a table with strings that represent the same things.

lib
    The lib field is like the bin field, except APIs are found instead of executables.

help
    The help field is like the bin field, except help files are found instead of executables.

startup
    This should be a string that points to the file the package wants to run at startup.

Example grin.json file:

{
    "bin": "programs",
    "lib": "apis",
    "help": "docs",
    "startup": "load.lua"
}
